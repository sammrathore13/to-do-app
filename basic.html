			<h4>At the top of a long page
you might want to add a list
of contents that links to the
corresponding sections lower
down. Or you might want to add
a link from part way down the
page back to the top of it to save
users from having to scroll back
to the top.
Before you can link to a specific
part of a page, you need to
identify the points in the page
that the link will go to. You do
this using the id attribute (which
can be used on every HTML
element). You can see that the
 and elements in this
example have been given id
attributes that identify those
sections of the page.
The value of the id attribute
should start with a letter or an
underscore (not a number or
any other character) and, on a
single page, no two id attributes
should have the same value</h4>
